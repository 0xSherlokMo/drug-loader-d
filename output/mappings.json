Using calcipotriene topical together with abaloparatide may occasionally cause your blood calcium levels to become too high.  You may need a dose adjustment or more frequent monitoring by your doctor to safely use both medications.  Contact your doctor if you experience signs and symptoms that may suggest excessive blood calcium levels such as dizziness, weakness, lethargy, muscle pain, headache, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and seizures.

Do not stop using any medications without first talking to your doctor.","ProfessionalEffect":"MONITOR:  Elevations in serum calcium levels have been observed in patients treated with topical vitamin D analogs.  Concomitant use with systemic vitamin D products, calcium supplements, or other agents that can increase serum calcium concentrations such as thiazide diuretics, estrogens, anabolic steroids, and parathyroid hormone or parathyroid hormone analogs may increase the risk of clinically significant hypercalcemia.  \n\nMANAGEMENT:  Calcium and vitamin D status should be monitored closely when topical vitamin D analogs are used in combination with systemic vitamin D products or other agents that can increase serum calcium levels."},{"name":"calcitriol topical","hashedName":"calcitriol topical abaloparatide","level":"Moderate","consumerEffect":"The medication in calcitriol topical is absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream and may cause interactions with other medications.

This is because abaloparatide briefly causes calcium levels to increase in the blood, and high calcium blood levels have been associated with toxic effects of digitoxin.  Contact your doctor if you experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, visual disturbances (blurred vision; light halos around objects; green or yellow vision), or an abnormally fast or slow or uneven heartbeat, as these may be signs and symptoms of excessive digitoxin effects.

Human parathyroid hormone analogs such as teriparatide and abaloparatide can cause transient increases in serum calcium levels, and some reports have implicated hypercalcemia in cases of digitalis toxicity.\n\nMANAGEMENT:  Caution is recommended during concomitant use of digitalis and human parathyroid hormone analogs.  Serum calcium and digitalis levels should be closely monitored, and the digitalis dosage adjusted as necessary.
